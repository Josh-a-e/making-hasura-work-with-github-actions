## Trying to make Hasura work with GitHub Actions

This one uses instructions for setup from here:
https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/deployment/docker/index.html

This is by running a `docker-run.sh` file, instead of running `docker-compose`.

There is also another project trying to do the same thing, but it uses `docker-compose` instead:
